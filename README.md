# Customer Personality Analysis using Python
Took data from Kaggle over the customers of a company to analyze how their preferences and taste affect the sales of a company.
In this the data contains details about the regular customers of the company. We've used Pandas for the manipulation of data and Numpy for running some numerical operations and matplot and seaborn for the visualisation of the data.
